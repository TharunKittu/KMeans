# KMeans
# PROJECT TITLE :
Analysis and prediction of "mall_customers.csv" of americial mall markets called as phonic mall to find out how many customers are visited to a particular shop.On the basis of this prediction of annual income versus spending score.

# DISCLAIMER :
In this particular dataset we assume annual income as a centriod and spending score from the range 1-100 called as data nodes of the clusters.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT 

The Americian finance market as per the gdp of 2011 'phonic_trillums mall'.As in the range out of i.The owner of the mall wants to be exact which particular shop or a product such in different kind of clusters in entire mall.
As a data science engineer predict the futuristic financial market for upcoming gdp range based on no.of clusters.The client want atleast top 5 clusters(shops).

# CONCLUSION:
According to the Model basic prediction using machine algorithm KMeans clustering we found that cluster1 which consist red color is a highest cluster which attach morethan 50 datanodes.

# REFERENCES:
The model building algorithm develop for all kinds of clusteration values.The yellow spots represents centeriods which is max to max 3
